# vvdoctor Feedback Implementation Progress

This markdown tracks completed feedback items from FEEDBACK.md, with testing instructions for each.

## Completed Items

### 1. Sidebar overcrowding (UI)
**Feedback:** The sidebar contains too many elements stacked vertically, making it feel cramped. Suggestion: Use tabs or accordion panels to organize controls by workflow stage.

**Implementation:** Refactored sidebar layout to use tab panels for each workflow stage: Data, Variables, Analysis, Results.

**How to Test:**
- Launch the vvdoctor Shiny app.
- Verify sidebar controls are grouped into tabs or accordions.
- Confirm each workflow stage is accessible and controls are logically organized.
- Check that the sidebar is less cluttered and easier to navigate.

### 2. Workflow clarity (UI)
**Feedback:** Users may not understand the intended sequence of actions. Add visual indicators (step numbers, progress bar, or breadcrumb navigation) to guide users through the analysis workflow: Upload Data → Select Variables → Choose Test → View Results.

**Implementation:** Added step numbers as labels above each major sidebar control to visually indicate the workflow sequence. (Progress bar or breadcrumbs can be added in future iterations.)

**How to Test:**
- Launch the vvdoctor Shiny app.
- Check that each sidebar section (data import, variable selection, test selection, results) is labeled with a step number (e.g., "Step 1: Upload Data").
- Confirm the workflow order is clear and guides the user through the analysis process.
- Ensure the step labels are visible and understandable.

### 3. Main panel underutilized (UI)
**Feedback:** The main panel only shows the data table and histogram. Suggestion: Add tabs for "Data Preview", "Variable Analysis", "Test Results", and "Interpretation" to better organize content and reduce cognitive load.

**Implementation:** Refactored the main panel to use tab panels for: Data Preview, Variable Analysis, Test Results, and Interpretation. Each tab displays relevant outputs (data table, histogram, test results, and a placeholder for interpretation).

**How to Test:**
- Launch the vvdoctor Shiny app.
- Verify the main panel now has tabs for Data Preview, Variable Analysis, Test Results, and Interpretation.
- Confirm each tab displays the correct content (data table, histogram, test results, interpretation text).
- Check that switching between tabs works and content is organized logically.

### 4. Error messaging (UX)
**Feedback:** Error messages are technical and displayed in the console output area. Implement user-friendly error notifications with clear, actionable messages displayed prominently.

**Implementation:** Updated error handling in server logic to display user-friendly error notifications using Shiny's `showNotification()` for common input and analysis errors.

**How to Test:**
- Launch the vvdoctor Shiny app.
- Trigger an error (e.g., upload an invalid file, select incompatible variables, run a test with missing data).
- Confirm that a clear, user-friendly error notification appears at the top of the app, describing the issue and suggesting an action.
- Ensure technical error details are not shown to the user.

---

### 5. Accessibility (UI)
**Feedback:** Screen readers cannot properly interpret the interface. Add `aria-label`, `aria-describedby`, and other ARIA attributes to form controls and interactive elements.

**Implementation:** Added `aria-label` attributes to key sidebar controls (data import, variable selection, test selection, results) for improved accessibility. More ARIA attributes can be added in future iterations.

**How to Test:**
- Launch the vvdoctor Shiny app.
- Use a screen reader to navigate the sidebar controls.
- Confirm that each control is announced with a descriptive label (e.g., "Import data", "Choose dependent variable").
- Ensure navigation and interaction are accessible for users with assistive technologies.
